**bzzzbz** is a video synthesizer that dynamically reacts to an audio input to create images and visuals that can be manipulated for integrated audio-visual performances.  <br>
This product is meant to be a simpler and cheaper alternative to commercial analog video synthesizers, still providing a flexible interface to enhance musical expression.

If you are a musician, a visual artist or are curious about the mesmerizing videos on the wall of your local techno club, build and use  **bzzzbz** to experiment and play with audio-reactive visuals! Among its main features, this open-source video synth gives you the live control of video parameters and the possibility of creating your own mappings and patterns for immersive audiovisual performances.
